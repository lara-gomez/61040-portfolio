# Assignment 1

## Domains
1. **Music Discovery**: Current music streaming apps often recommend the same type of music to me.
I would like to gain exposure to more varied music. I would also like to learn more about
what my friends like to listen to in one unified place. I want to keep track of my thoughts 
on different songs as well.

2. **Community Finding**: In situations like moving to a new city after graduating, it is
challenging to build up a community in situations outside of a structured setting like college.
Many cities have plenty of events and classes to go to, but it may be difficult to 
narrow down which of them to follow through with. I would like to have one place to find
events that may interest me and are recommended to me based on my current interests to meet
more people.

3. **Dinner Party Get Togethers**: My friends and I like to host dinner parties every so often.
This involves coordinating different people's schedules to find the best date and time, as well
as consolidating all dietary restrictions. We also pick themes and menus accordingly, and invest
in decorations for set up purposes. Dress codes are suggested and followed. We often struggle
to split the price of everything evenly among all guests, as well as keeping all guests' information
in one place and choosing the right theme.

4. Reading Books: Combine Book Discovery with Chapter-Level Reflection

5. Fitness & Wellbeing: Managing Subscriptions and Planning Fitness Classes 

6. Cooking: Recipe Finding and Tracking Ingredients

7. Financial Literacy: Budgeting and Long Term Financial Planning 

8. Finding Educational Mentorship: Connecting with Mentors

9. Email and Efficient Meeting Management

10. Travel Logistics: Budgeting, Itineraries, and Group Coordination

## Problems

### Music Discovery
1. Repetitive recommendations and sticking within the same music genres/artists.
    - Unselected: Recommendations tend to be based on whatever song the user originally selected,
    and this might be grounds for improving current streaming app algorithms rather than
    creating a new project since the critical mass is already on other apps. If they actively wanted to seek out another genre, apps like Apple Music and Spotify both offer tailored playlists that a user is likely to enjoy. 

2. No unified place with friends' song likes/ratings.
    - Title: Reviewing and Liking Music
    - Selected: There is not a popular app which is socially focused on music. Although streaming apps
    such as Spotify allow users to see what their friends are currently listening to, there is no
    way to see which songs a user might recommend to their friend in one consolidated place. Friends
    often send me songs through the messages app, but I often lose track. I also want to keep track of my
    own thoughts on songs, and see what my friends think of some songs.

3. Inconsistent playlist mood not fitting user needs.
    - Unselected: There would not be enough interest in this problem for users to move away from their
    popular streaming apps. This problem can be solved on an individual level with users creating more
    playlists and finding new ones, which is very easy to do on most music streaming apps.

### Community Finding
1. It's hard to make friends or find a community in a city where you don't know anybody already. 
    - Unselected: This problem is already being tackled by other popular apps. For example, Bumble
    is expanding to include a friends feature as well which might be easier for users to gravitate to.

2. Too many events in a city happening at once; hard to keep track and pick which ones to go to.
    - Title: Event Overload
    - Selected: In any given city, there might be too many events or communities that you belong to.
    It's easy to feel like you are missing out on events that you would have more fun at, or that
    you consistently pick events that aren't as enjoyable as expected. Instead, you
    feel like you wasted time, missed out on better connections, and are not in a community that fits
    your interests. I selected this problem because I feel like finding events that fit your interests
    is essential to building a new community. For people that are moving to new cities, I believe there is
    a large need for finding a strong support system and fun events is a convenient way to do so.

3. The quality of annual/monthly city events are unclear from advertisements and lack of reviews.
    - Unselected: Reviews for city events that happen often can be found on sites like Yelp or
    Google Reviews, even if they are outdated sometimes. Users could browse these websites to get
    a feel of these events, which makes a centralized app seem unnecessary with limited demand.

### Dinner Party Get Togethers
1. Coordinating all guest attendance and dietary restrictions.
    - Unselected: I did not select this problem because there are already apps that address
    guest lists such as Partiful. For dietary restrictions, this is already effectively solved through
    general notetaking that the host would keep close track of. 

2. Picking a theme for the dinner party and finding fitting recipes.
    - Title: Find Dinner Party Theme and Menu
    - Selected: I chose to select this problem because finding a dinner party theme that is not
    repetitive and is unique can be challenging. It would be nice to keep track of past themes,
    as well as find which recipes and ingredients would go best with the general event. The event
    outcome is largely determined by the ambiance presented to the audience, so having an app that
    recommends themes and helps find menus/recipes would be very helpful and increase overall enjoyment.

3. Awkward interactions and gaps in conversation between guests.
    - Unselected: I did not choose to select this problem because it would be up to the guests to improve
    the quality of their conversation. The host could do a better job of providing icebreakers
    and it is unlikely people use this app when there are plenty of resources available
    to aid conversation outside of an online app.

## Stakeholders
### Reviewing and Liking Music
- Stakeholders: Reviewer (user who is reviewing and liking music selections), Friend (friend of the user
who can see what the reviewer liked and leave reviews for the reviewer to see), Artist (individual/s who
produce music)

- Impact: The reviewer and the friend will most likely have negative consequences from poorly crafted
reviews, since they might miss out on music they might have enjoyed. The artist will also suffer
consequences depending on the reviews. Good reviews could lead to increased popularity, whereas
bad reviews could taint their reputation. In the same vain, well written reviews and ratings for songs
will allow users to diversify their music taste and benefit from seeing their friends' song recommendations.

### Event Overload
- Stakeholders: Event organizers, city (as a whole, on administrative and citizen level), user (the
person who is looking to attend city events and to find community)

- Impact: Event organizer wants to maximize people who come to event while also accounting for 
appropriate amount of resources required; therefore, they want to identify users who would be most
interested in attending. Users want to find events that maximize their personal enjoyment, leading
to increased positive interactions with the event organizers. The opposite is true when enjoyment is
minimal. Events that attract more users could allow these organizers to acquire more funding from the city. The city also benefits from having citizens who are happier since they will be likely to stay in the city for longer periods of time and contribute financially.

### Find Dinner Party Theme and Menu
- Stakeholders: Host (the person hosting the dinner party), friend (a person attending the dinner party),
grocery store (store where hosts acquire ingredients from)

- Impact: The host wants to maximize enjoyment from their guests, and guests also have interest in
having a pleasant dinner through food and ambiance. The host benefits from guests who have a good experience since they are more likely to attend a dinner party again in the future, or recommend more people to be invited next time. More dinner parties means more money will go back to the grocery store where the ingredients are being acquired from.

## Evidence
### Reviewing and Liking Music
1. [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/): This website allows users to discover music through browsing personalized music charts and a platform to rate and review songs on a scale of 5. However, the friend feature does not allow users to comment on each others' ratings, and there is not a clear friend feed to see this activity in one place.

2. [Why Isn’t there a decent, working music-rating app?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/n4sj9e/why_isnt_there_a_decent_working_musicrating_app/): A Reddit post dives deeper into the lack of
a social driven music-rating app. Comments agree on the downfalls of existing attempts at this problem,
including but not limited to outdated UIs, lacking databases, and unintuitive searches. 

3. [There are a few reasons why a widely popular, effective music-rating app doesn’t exist or hasn’t taken off](https://medium.com/@zeynco/why-dont-we-have-decent-music-review-and-rating-apps-2afd3c340d34): Cons of developing a music rating platform include too many songs, platforms already incorporate some feedback through a "liked song" feature, and music preferences are too diverse/subjective. However, most music focused apps are focused on discovery rather than rating and connecting with friends.

4. [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) An example of a socially driven review app which focuses on movies rather than music. Users can see and comment on their friends reviews, as well as track films that they are interested in seeing.

5. [RateYourMusic Case Study: an Examination of RYM’s UX Flaws](https://medium.com/@justicedsn/rateyourmusic-case-study-an-examination-of-ryms-ux-flaws-dca7f724462b): The app is hard to use, too minimalist and outdated, and unintuitive to write reviews. This could be drawing away demand for this type of application, and this case study also offers improvements to use.

6. [Evaluating the Impact of Social Media on Music and Video Distribution](https://www.cachefly.com/news/evaulating-the-impact-of-social-media-on-music-and-video-distribution/) Social media platforms have songs that often blow up and work their way into the playlists of many users, significantly influencing the way in which users discover music. Social media has become one of the main avenues to do so.

7. [Beli](https://beliapp.com/) An app dedicated to tracking and sharing your favorite restaurants with your friends. Get access to personalized recs for restaurants. This is another example of a demand for users who want to engage with their friends' reviews in another aspect of their life. There is demand for movies and restaurants, so music is a natural expansion from there.

### Find Dinner Party Theme and Menu
1. Theme Suggestions: Generate themes either randomly or based on the success of past dinner party themes. Can be suggested on the basis of desired recipes, or through given words and phrases that are input. Guests should also be able to suggest themes for the host to try.

2. Recipe Recommendations: Based on themes and past recipes, users should have access to recipes that they may want to try. You should also be able to bookmark recipes you may want to try in the future.

3. Guest Ratings: Guests should be able to rate the dinner party anonymously based on their experience. This includes insights on the decor, quality of food and ingredients, and the overall theme. This will allow the host to improve and also track the quality of their time spent at this dinner party. The grocery store will also benefit from higher ratings since it indicates good ingredients.
